        - The user explicitly requests to speak with a human agent
        - The conversation requires human expertise beyond the AI's capabilities
        - The user is frustrated or dissatisfied with automated responses
        - Complex issues require human judgment and empathy
        - The conversation involves sensitive topics that need human handling
        - Escalation is needed based on predefined transfer rules
        
        Transfer Rules:
        If transfer_rules are configured in the agent, use them to determine who to transfer to.
        Each rule has:
        - transferTo: "human" or "team"
        - userId: ID of the user to transfer to (if transferTo is "human")
        - teamId: ID of the team to transfer to (if transferTo is "team")
        - instructions: When to use this rule (e.g., "quando o contato pedir")
        
        If no transfer_rules are configured, you must provide assignee_id or team_id.
        
    Args:
        assignee_id: The ID of the human agent to assign the conversation to (optional if transfer_rules are configured)

    transfer_to_human.__doc__ = f"""Transfer a conversation to a human agent.

    Use this tool when the user requests human assistance, when complex issues require
    human expertise, or when escalation is needed based on transfer rules.

    If transfer_rules are configured, you MUST pass rule_index set to the number of
    whichever configured rule below actually matches what the user asked about — do
    not omit it and rely on a default, there is no single "default" rule and omitting
    it risks the wrong team. Otherwise, provide assignee_id or team_id
    explicitly.{transfer_rules_doc}

    IMPORTANT: if the matched rule's instructions say to notify the customer before
    transferring (most do), you MUST pass message_to_customer with that notice — do
    NOT rely on separately replying with text in the same turn, since when you call
    tools you often don't also produce a customer-facing message, and the transfer
    would then happen silently. Passing message_to_customer here guarantees it is
    sent before the transfer, regardless of whether you also write reply text.

    Args:
        conversation_id: The ID of the conversation to transfer (optional, auto-extracted)
        assignee_id: The ID of the human agent to assign to (optional if transfer_rules configured)
        team_id: Optional team ID to assign to a team instead (optional if transfer_rules configured)
        rule_index: The 1-based number of the configured transfer rule (above) that matches
            this situation. Required whenever transfer_rules are configured and you are not
            passing assignee_id/team_id explicitly.
        reason: Optional reason for transfer (for logging)
        message_to_customer: A short customer-facing message sent BEFORE the transfer
            (e.g. "Vou te encaminhar para o Departamento X, só um instante."). Required
            whenever the matched rule's instructions ask you to notify the customer first.

    Returns:
        Dictionary with transfer status and details
