Manage Conversation Labels Tool

This tool allows agents to list, add and remove labels on the current
conversation. Backend endpoints used:

- GET  /api/v1/conversations/{id}/labels  -> list current labels
- POST /api/v1/conversations/{id}/labels  -> replace labels (with `{labels: [...]}`)

The upstream POST is destructive (it replaces the full label list), so this
tool reads the current labels first and computes the union/difference before
writing back, preserving labels the user did not explicitly remove.

        action: "list" | "add" | "remove"
        labels: label title or list of titles (required for add/remove)
        conversation_id: optional UUID, auto-extracted from context when omitted

    Returns:
        Dictionary with action result and the resulting label list. For
        `add`, also includes `rejected`: titles that were skipped because
        they don't exist in the account's label catalog.
